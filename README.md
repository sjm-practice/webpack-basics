# webpack-basics

A simple project to learn webpack basics. Following along with LinkedIn Learning Webpack 1 tutorial.

## Resources
* https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-webpack-1

## Notes
* using webpack to inline images reduces http calls
  - uses url-loader, file-loader
* NOTE, ran in to some trouble trying to get the background image to display. the path wasn't getting set correctly for some reason
  - I did add file loader options of path and name, which did work, still doesn't seem optimally configured
